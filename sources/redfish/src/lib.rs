//! Redfish acquisition.
//!
//! Four polled providers ship, one [`Read`] envelope each: [`SensorRead`] —
//! one sensor `OData` GET projected into a readings batch and a states
//! batch, per `docs/DATA-MODEL.md`'s worked example — [`ChassisRead`] — one
//! chassis GET projected into an inventory batch and a states batch —
//! [`LogRead`] — a walk over a log service's entries projected into logs
//! batches — and [`FirmwareRead`] — a walk over the update service's
//! firmware inventory projected into an inventory batch and a states batch.
//! One streamed provider ships beside them: [`EventStream`] — the
//! endpoint's server-sent events, one item per `Event` payload, projected
//! into logs batches under the event service's own scope. Transport rides
//! nv-redfish's `Bmc` trait, so the providers are
//! generic over HTTP and the mock the fixture corpus replays through;
//! reqwest and tokio enter the workspace only here, behind the `bmc-http`
//! feature.
//!
//! Projection is *declared* in `manifests/` and compiled into
//! `src/generated/` by `make codegen`: deterministic, I/O-free functions
//! from a decoded source type and its location to observation parts plus
//! issues, pinned by the corpus under `tests/`. `projection/` re-exports
//! the generated boundary the provider consumes.
//!
//! Reserved for later milestones: catalog stages (`ServiceRoot` walks that
//! retain sensor links privately), the bulk `TelemetryService` provider,
//! session handling, and the vendor-leniency layer real BMCs require.
