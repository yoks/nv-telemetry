/// entry projects at its own location. A member the device answered for but
/// would not serve — rotated out between the collection and the member GET,
/// say — is recorded against `Members[i]` and the walk continues. Anything
/// else ends the walk and discards what it had projected: an endpoint-scoped
/// failure indicts the endpoint rather than one entry, and the collector's
/// own fault is never device data. The acquisition contract is all-or-nothing
/// for the unit, so a recurring per-member timeout on a long log means the
/// log never ships and the endpoint breaker samples the timeout.
///
/// The walk is budgeted ([`WalkBudget`]): it holds the endpoint's admission
/// slot and buffers projected records for its duration, and the dispatcher
/// meters it as one unit of cost. **The budget keeps the newest entries.**
/// Most logs list entries oldest first, so a walk that spent its budget from
/// the head would never show a consumer the records that arrived since the
/// last poll; instead the walk reads the order off the member ids, visits the
/// newest members first, and when an oldest-first collection is paged jumps
/// to the tail with `$skip` before following `Members@odata.nextLink` to the
/// end. What the budget cuts off is the
/// oldest, reported once at [`TRUNCATED_WALK_LOCATOR`]. The deadline cancels
/// pending I/O and fails the acquisition with Timeout, discarding its output.
/// Neither bound covers the collection response the transport decodes; that
/// is the transport's response-size limit, which nv-redfish 0.16's typed API
/// does not expose here. A successful batch is `PARTIAL`, and the next poll
/// starts where this one ended: the read keeps a [`LogCursor`], so a poll
/// ships the entries that arrived since the last one shipped, and the budget
/// caps how many new entries one poll may carry. Records ride one `Logs`
/// batch per bound's worth; the issues envelope's own bound is kept by

///

/// costs the new entries plus one member rather than the whole window, and a
/// consumer stops seeing every record repeated each poll. Position, not
/// time, places a record: an entry stamped before the cursor's member is
/// simply a newer member — a device whose clock stepped back, or an event
/// from another clock, ships once and moves the cursor on — and an entry
/// the device does not stamp is placed like any other. The cursor's member
/// ends the walk whatever it answers: one that cannot be read this poll is
/// reported and still stops the walk, rather than letting it overshoot into
/// entries already shipped.
///
/// The stamp tells a refilled log apart from the same entry. A log cleared
/// and refilled reuses its ids; meeting the cursor's id under another stamp
/// means nothing present was shipped, so the cursor is discarded and the
/// whole window ships once. A refill that lands the same id on the same
/// second is invisible, which the second's resolution makes unavoidable. A
/// cursor whose member has left the log — rotated out, or cleared without a
/// refill reaching its id — is never met, and the window ships as new, which
/// on an append-only log it is.
///
/// Entries that projected no record are never shipped and never anchor the
/// cursor: a faulty entry is reported each time it is met.
///
/// The order the collection lists members in is read off numbered ids and
/// otherwise assumed oldest first. A wrong assumption shows itself in one of
/// two ways: the log grows, yet the end taken for newest holds only the
/// cursor's member; or the cursor's member is gone while the log did not
/// grow, which on the true order takes a whole log's worth of new entries
/// but on the wrong order takes one. Either way the walk reads the member at
/// the other end, and only if it is stamped after the one taken for newest
/// flips the order and walks again — once re-shipping what the first walk
/// anchored behind. An insertion elsewhere in an oldest-first log fails that
/// check and flips nothing. An order a probe established outranks the ids
/// from then on.
///
/// Where the next walk starts depends on what the device offers. A device
/// whose service root advertises `ProtocolFeaturesSupported.FilterQuery` is
/// asked for the members stamped at or after the cursor's — `$filter` on
/// `Created`, the cursor's own second included so its member anchors the
/// walk — and an idle poll is one collection request and one member. The
/// cursor's own test still decides what ships, so a device that advertises
/// the filter and answers with everything costs pages, never duplicates; a
/// device that refuses the filtered request is remembered as not filtering,
/// and the poll that learned it says so once at [`FILTER_REFUSED_LOCATOR`].
/// Support is learned once per read: a device that starts advertising later
/// is asked again only when the read is recreated. A filtered answer places
/// by stamp where the walk places by position: an entry written after the
/// cursor's member but stamped before its second — a clock stepped back, an
/// event stamped by another clock — is not in it. Two signs of that send a
/// poll to the head instead. A service whose own `DateTime` reads earlier
/// than the cursor's stamp has stepped back; and an honored filter answers
/// the cursor's own member at least, so an empty answer means the log was
/// cleared, refilled at earlier stamps, or the device answered nothing to a
/// filter it did not parse. An entry stamped behind the cursor by a clock the
/// service does not report stays out of view while the filter is honored. A
/// filtered answer wider than the cursor's member yet walked to it first has
/// the order checked as a head walk stalled on growth would, and one larger
/// than the budget is entered at its tail with `$skip` as the collection
/// would be.
/// Otherwise the count the collection held when the position was stored is
/// where an oldest-first paged log is entered: `$skip` to that index less
/// one, the cursor's member if nothing rotated, so an idle poll reads the
/// first page, the tail page, and one member whatever the log's size. A walk
/// that does not meet the cursor's member there, or meets its id under
/// another stamp, reads the collection from its head instead. Filtered
/// polls leave that count as it was: their count is the filter's, and the
/// index only matters once the filter stops being honored.
///
/// One per [`Read`], shared by its clones; not persisted, so a restart
/// replays one window, bounded by [`WalkBudget`]. When the endpoint policy
/// admits more than one poll at a time, a slow walk can overlap the next
/// tick; the cursor is held for the whole load–walk–store, and the
