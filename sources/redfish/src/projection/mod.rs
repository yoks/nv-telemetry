//! Projection: typed Redfish shapes become validated observation parts.
//!
//! The bodies are generated from `manifests/` by `make codegen`; this
//! module is the boundary the provider consumes. Two disciplines hold in
//! everything the compiler emits:
//!
//! - Every field is evaluated on every projection — no early return — so one
//!   report carries every issue, not just the first.
//! - Nothing is fabricated. A field that is absent, null, or unusable
//!   produces no observation; unusable additionally produces an issue,
//!   because the device answered and the answer cannot be represented, which
//!   is a different fact from silence.
